# Python For Kids
My son is 10 years old, and I want to assign some projects for him to start learn Python.

# Project 1: vs code IDE setup
Time allocation: 2 days
## Preparation
My son knows how to play Roblox on Windows, but never touch IDE like vs code. So I spent two minutes to show him below links, opened vs code in my laptop, then write a Helloworld python file and run the .py to let him know what's the expectation.

## Goal
1. Download and install [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install [Python and the Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python#_install-python-and-the-python-extension) 
3. Finish parts of [Python-tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) until `Configure and run the debugger`, and stop at `Install and use packages`

![Python-tutorial scope](img/PythonTutorial.jpg?raw=true "Title")

Skip things like `Data Science`, `Windows Subsystem for Linux`, `Anaconda`

4. Make a video to install vs code, python extension and create `Hello World` python file, then run it.
